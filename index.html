<p>Welcome to my site! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at U.C. Berkeley. My research focuses on the interaction between the government and firms, with an emphasize on R&amp;D and innovation. I received a Msc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from LSE and a Bachelor in Economics from Nankai University.</p>
<p>I am on the job market in 2020-2021. I am available for interview during the NABE TEC2020 meeting and 2021 ASSA meeting.</p>
<p>Here are my <a href="cv_Hou_Junyi.pdf">cv</a> and <a href="resume_Hou_Junyi.pdf">resume</a></p>

<p>Despite the rapid expansion of the R&amp;D sector in China, factor market wedges create considerable welfare loss by misallocating R&amp;D inputs across Chinese firms. Specifically, private firms have Worse factor market access than state-owned firms. This disadvantage reduces private innovators&rsquo; profits when they compete with state-owned incumbents. Thus, the wedge distorts incentives to invest in R&amp;D, lowers aggregate innovation, and leads to slower productivity growth. I develop and structurally estimate an endogenous growth model with a factor market wedge to capture this effect. Removing the wedge increases annual productivity growth by 1.2 percentage points and total welfare by 23%. Compared with the static loss from cross-sectional markup dispersion, the dynamic loss from misallocation in the R&amp;D sector accounts for 90% of the total welfare loss. Distortions to R&amp;D incentives are the primary cause of misallocation in the R&amp;D sector. These distortions are quantitatively important in explaining the welfare loss.</p>

<p>I estimate the effect of the 2004 Chinese banking reform on the allocation of credits. Before the reform, connection to the government allows state-owned firms to have preferential access to credit from state-owned banks. The banking reform weakens the effect of government connections by putting loan performance pressures on loan officers. Using exogenous variations in the numbers of state-owned firms resulting from a high-profile national defense project, I find that the banking reform reduces TFPR dispersion more in cities with more state-owned firms. Furthermore, the results are driven by improving credit access to high performing private firms who lack access to credit prior to the reform. With the newly acquired credit, these private firms invest more and grow faster. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows the banking reform improves the allocative efficiency by over 20%, measured by TFPR dispersion at the city level.</p>

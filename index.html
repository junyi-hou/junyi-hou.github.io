<p>Welcome to my site! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at U.C. Berkeley. My research focuses on the interaction between the government and firms, with a focus on innovation. I received a Msc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from LSE and a Bachelor in Economics from Nankai University.</p>
<p>I am on the job market in 2020-2021 and available for interview during the NABE TEC2020 meeting and 2021 ASSA meeting.</p>
<p>Here are my <a href="cv_Hou_Junyi.pdf">cv</a> and <a href="resume_Hou_Junyi.pdf">resume</a></p>

<p>I find China&rsquo;s state capitalism policy creates large productivity and welfare loss. To show this, I develop an endogenous growth model of state-owned and private firms. In the model, political connections grant state-owned firms better factor market access. Such privilege leads to higher return to R&amp;D investment for state-owned firms. Furthermore, the competitive pressure from privileged state-owned firms lowers the return to innovation for private firms, thus discouraging them from investing in R&amp;D. I structurally estimate the model using Chinese industrial firm data. Results show that state-owned firms are inefficient in producing innovation. Nevertheless, they invest more in R&amp;D than private firms due to their higher expected return. Removing state-owned firms&rsquo; privileged market access increases annual productivity growth by 1.2 percentage points and total welfare by 23%.</p>

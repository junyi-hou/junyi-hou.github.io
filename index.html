<p>Welcome to my site! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at U.C. Berkeley. My research focuses on the interaction between the government and firms, with a focus on innovation policies. I received a Msc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from LSE and a Bachelor in Economics from Nankai University.</p>
<p>I am on the job market in 2020-2021. I am available for interview during the NABE TEC2020 meeting and 2021 ASSA meeting.</p>
<p>Here are my <a href="cv_Hou_Junyi.pdf">cv</a> and <a href="resume_Hou_Junyi.pdf">resume</a></p>

<p>I find static market wedges can lead to large distortions in the R&amp;D sector, resulting in slower productivity growth. To show this, I develop an endogenous growth model of state-owned and private firms. In the model, political connections grant state-owned firms better factor market access. Such privilege leads to higher return to R&amp;D investments for state-owned firms. Furthermore, the competitive pressure from privileged state-owned firms lowers the return to innovation for private firms, thus discouraging them from investing in R&amp;D. I structurally estimate the model using Chinese industrial firm data. Results show that state-owned firms are inefficient in producing innovation. Nevertheless, they invest more in R&amp;D than private firms because of their higher expected return. This leads to misallocation in the R&amp;D sector. Removing state-owned firms&rsquo; privileged market access increases annual productivity growth by 1.2 percentage points and total welfare by 23%. A decomposition of welfare effect shows dynamic loss from lower growth rate accounts for 90% of the welfare loss.</p>

<p>I estimate the effect of 2004 Chinese banking reform on the allocative efficiency of credit. Using exogenous variations in the density of politically connected firms resulting from a high-profile national defense project from 1960s, I find the banking reform reduces TFPR dispersion more in cities with more connected firms. Furthermore, the results are driven by better access to credit by politically unconnected firms, who lacks access to credit prior to the reform. With the newly acquired credit, these unconnected firms invest more and grow faster. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows the banking reform improves the allocative efficiency by over 20% (measured using TFPR dispersion).</p>
